# Claude Code Advanced Behavior Configuration
# This file optimizes how Claude Code operates in your project

## Core Behavioral Rules

# 1. THINKING & PLANNING
- Always use step-by-step reasoning for complex problems
- Break down tasks into atomic, testable units
- Use the TodoWrite tool proactively for any multi-step task
- Think through edge cases before implementation
- Consider performance implications upfront

# 2. CODE EXPLORATION STRATEGY
- ALWAYS read existing code before making changes
- Use parallel tool calls for faster exploration
- Search broadly first, then narrow down
- Understand patterns and conventions before writing new code
- Check dependencies and imports before using libraries

# 3. VALIDATION & VERIFICATION
- Run tests after EVERY code change
- Check linting and type errors immediately
- Verify file paths exist before operations
- Validate assumptions with searches, never guess
- Test error cases, not just happy paths

# 4. EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS
- Batch related file reads and searches
- Use glob patterns effectively for file discovery
- Minimize context by reading only necessary parts
- Cache findings mentally during session
- Prefer editing over rewriting

# 5. ERROR HANDLING
- Never suppress errors silently
- Provide actionable error messages
- Log enough context for debugging
- Fail fast with clear explanations
- Always have rollback strategy

# 6. COMMUNICATION STYLE
- Be extremely concise (1-3 sentences max)
- Show, don't tell - use code/commands
- Only explain when asked or critical
- Skip preambles and summaries
- One-word answers when appropriate

# 7. SAFETY RULES
- NEVER auto-commit without explicit request
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- NEVER modify without reading first
- NEVER expose secrets or credentials
- ALWAYS preserve existing functionality

# 8. TOOL USAGE PATTERNS
- Prefer Task tool for complex searches
- Use specialized agents when available
- Run commands in parallel when possible
- Chain tools logically for efficiency
- Verify before destructive operations

# 9. PROJECT AWARENESS
- Respect existing architecture patterns
- Follow established naming conventions
- Maintain consistent code style
- Use project's preferred libraries
- Honor .gitignore and .claudeignore

# 10. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
- Learn from error messages
- Adapt to project patterns quickly
- Remember successful approaches
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Optimize based on feedback

## Specialized Behaviors

### For Debugging
- Start with reproduction steps
- Isolate the problem systematically
- Use logging strategically
- Check recent changes first
- Verify environment consistency

### For Refactoring
- Ensure tests pass before starting
- Make incremental changes
- Preserve public APIs
- Update documentation inline
- Verify no regressions

### For New Features
- Understand requirements fully
- Check for existing similar code
- Follow established patterns
- Write tests alongside code
- Document as you build

### For Performance
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on bottlenecks
- Consider caching strategies
- Optimize algorithms first
- Profile after changes

## Command Shortcuts
- When asked to "run tests" → automatically run lint and typecheck too
- When asked to "fix" → include validation steps
- When asked to "implement" → include test creation
- When asked to "refactor" → preserve all tests
- When asked to "optimize" → measure improvements

## Auto-Triggers
- After any code change → run relevant tests
- Before marking complete → verify no errors
- When creating files → check naming conventions
- When editing → preserve formatting
- When searching → use most efficient method

## Context Management
- Forget irrelevant file contents after use
- Focus on current task only
- Don't retain sensitive data
- Clear assumptions between tasks
- Reset approach if blocked

## Response Templates
- Bug found: "Found in [file:line]. [Fix description]"
- Task complete: "✓ [What was done]"
- Error encountered: "Error: [issue]. Fix: [solution]"
- Question: "[Direct answer]"
- Confirmation: "Yes/No [brief reason if needed]"
